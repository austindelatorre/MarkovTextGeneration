       "'THERE IS WIDE AGREEMENT THAT PHILOSOPHY IS CHARACTERIZED BY VARIOUS GENERAL FEATURES IT IS A FORM OF RATIONAL INQUIRY IT AIMS TO BE SYSTEMATIC AND IT TENDS TO CRITICALLY REFLECT ON ITS OWN METHODS AND PRESUPPOSITIONS. BUT APPROACHES THAT GO BEYOND SUCH VAGUE CHARACTERIZATIONS TO GIVE A MORE INTERESTING OR PROFOUND DEFINITION ARE USUALLY CONTROVERSIAL. OFTEN THEY ARE ONLY ACCEPTED BY THEORISTS BELONGING TO A CERTAIN PHILOSOPHICAL MOVEMENT AND ARE REVISIONISTIC IN THAT MANY PRESUMED PARTS OF PHILOSOPHY WOULD NOT DESERVE THE TITLE PHILOSOPHY IF THEY WERE TRUE. BEFORE THE MODERN AGE THE TERM WAS USED IN A VERY WIDE SENSE WHICH INCLUDED THE INDIVIDUAL SCIENCES LIKE PHYSICS OR MATHEMATICS AS ITS SUBDISCIPLINES BUT THE CONTEMPORARY USAGE IS MORE NARROW. SOME APPROACHES ARGUE THAT THERE IS A SET OF ESSENTIAL FEATURES SHARED BY ALL PARTS OF PHILOSOPHY WHILE OTHERS SEE ONLY WEAKER FAMILY RESEMBLANCES OR CONTEND THAT IT IS MERELY AN EMPTY BLANKET TERM. SOME DEFINITIONS CHARACTERIZE PHILOSOPHY IN RELATION TO ITS METHOD LIKE PURE REASONING. OTHERS FOCUS MORE ON ITS TOPIC FOR EXAMPLE AS THE STUDY OF THE BIGGEST PATTERNS OF THE WORLD AS A WHOLE OR AS THE ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE BIG QUESTIONS. BOTH APPROACHES HAVE THE PROBLEM THAT THEY ARE USUALLY EITHER TOO WIDE BY INCLUDING NONPHILOSOPHICAL DISCIPLINES OR TOO NARROW BY EXCLUDING SOME PHILOSOPHICAL SUBDISCIPLINES. MANY DEFINITIONS OF PHILOSOPHY EMPHASIZE ITS INTIMATE RELATION TO SCIENCE. IN THIS SENSE PHILOSOPHY IS SOMETIMES UNDERSTOOD AS A PROPER SCIENCE IN ITS OWN RIGHT. SOME NATURALIST APPROACHES FOR EXAMPLE SEE PHILOSOPHY AS AN EMPIRICAL YET VERY ABSTRACT SCIENCE THAT IS CONCERNED WITH VERY WIDERANGING EMPIRICAL PATTERNS INSTEAD OF PARTICULAR OBSERVATIONS. SOME PHENOMENOLOGISTS ON THE OTHER HAND CHARACTERIZE PHILOSOPHY AS THE SCIENCE OF ESSENCES. SCIENCEBASED DEFINITIONS USUALLY FACE THE PROBLEM OF EXPLAINING WHY PHILOSOPHY IN ITS LONG HISTORY HAS NOT MADE THE TYPE OF PROGRESS AS SEEN IN OTHER SCIENCES. THIS PROBLEM IS AVOIDED BY SEEING PHILOSOPHY AS AN IMMATURE OR PROVISIONAL SCIENCE WHOSE SUBDISCIPLINES CEASE TO BE PHILOSOPHY ONCE THEY HAVE FULLY DEVELOPED. IN THIS SENSE PHILOSOPHY IS THE MIDWIFE OF THE SCIENCES. OTHER DEFINITIONS FOCUS MORE ON THE CONTRAST BETWEEN SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY. A COMMON THEME AMONG MANY SUCH DEFINITIONS IS THAT PHILOSOPHY IS CONCERNED WITH MEANING UNDERSTANDING OR THE CLARIFICATION OF LANGUAGE. ACCORDING TO ONE VIEW PHILOSOPHY IS CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS WHICH INVOLVES FINDING THE NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR THE APPLICATION OF CONCEPTS. ANOTHER DEFINES PHILOSOPHY AS A LINGUISTIC THERAPY THAT AIMS AT DISPELLING MISUNDERSTANDINGS TO WHICH HUMANS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE DUE TO THE CONFUSING STRUCTURE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE. ONE MORE APPROACH HOLDS THAT THE MAIN TASK OF PHILOSOPHY IS TO ARTICULATE THE PREONTOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD WHICH ACTS AS A CONDITION OF POSSIBILITY OF EXPERIENCE.MANY OTHER DEFINITIONS OF PHILOSOPHY DO NOT CLEARLY FALL INTO ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED CATEGORIES. AN EARLY APPROACH ALREADY FOUND IN ANCIENT GREEK AND ROMAN PHILOSOPHY IS THAT PHILOSOPHY IS THE SPIRITUAL PRACTICE OF DEVELOPING ONES REASONING ABILITY. THIS PRACTICE IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE PHILOSOPHERS LOVE OF WISDOM AND HAS THE AIM OF IMPROVING ONES WELLBEING BY LEADING A REFLECTIVE LIFE. A CLOSELY RELATED APPROACH IDENTIFIES THE DEVELOPMENT AND ARTICULATION OF WORLDVIEWS AS THE PRINCIPAL TASK OF PHILOSOPHY I.E. TO EXPRESS HOW THINGS ON THE GRAND SCALE HANG TOGETHER AND WHICH PRACTICAL STANCE WE SHOULD TAKE TOWARDS THEM. ANOTHER DEFINITION CHARACTERIZES PHILOSOPHY AS THINKING ABOUT THINKING IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE ITS REFLECTIVE NATURE. '"
