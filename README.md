# Markov Text Generation
#### C.A.R.L. (Computer Assisted Real Language)
Just some boys tying to make a mediocre auto text completion software using the powers given to us from Carl McTague. 

## Current Testing Usage

- Make sure to install node.js
- Make sure current directory is src
- run ```python main.py``` to generate dictionary "dict.json" (currently 1 to 5 degrees) for the urls in "urls.txt"
- run ```node json_to_js.js``` to test text prediction with dictionary "dict.json"
  - Need to use the function ```predict_words``` in react part of application 


## Using this Repository
- please be careful using github. Make sure when you push changes you are pushing your own code to the script you are working on. You can really mess stuff up if you are not careful.
- Make sure to comment inline with your code and put proper commit messages with every commit.

 A very hacky first implementation of the concept. 
## To-Do
- Data Scraping for training text
